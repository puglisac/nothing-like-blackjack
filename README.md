# Assignment 2: Nothing Like Blackjack

This is an exercise for the coursera course [Introduction to C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-programming-unity)

## Assignment Description

Imagine you've decided to write a program to play a game that's nothing like Blackjack. You hope to get rich by selling your game to the casinos in Las Vegas, so you want to do a great job!

In this assignment, you'll deal two cards to four players (including the dealer), then give one more card to a couple of the players. Finally, you'll flip over and print the cards for each player. You might as well start shopping for your new McLaren now.
